## Introduction

This project is a commission from the [CNES](https://cnes.fr/) (Centre National d'Études Spatiales), the French space agency.
The purpose of this project is to develop a web-based interface to visualize FPGA signal propagation. The target users include:

- **Teachers** who upload their FPGA designs and use the tool to teach their students.
- **Students** who interact with the simulator to observe and analyze FPGA behavior.

The system doesn't have any mandatory framework or library to use, but the team is free to use any of them. The only constraint is that the system must be web-based. It's the reason why the team chose to use the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library for the front end and the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library for the web interface.

### Objectives

The main objective of this project is to provide an interactive 2D visualization of FPGA structures and signal routing. The system should be able to simulate signal propagation in real time with time-based animations, allowing users to see how signals travel through an FPGA design. Teachers should have the capability to upload Verilog applications and test benches, which students can then use to run and analyze simulations. The interface should be intuitive, engaging, and informative, making it easier for students to grasp the fundamentals of FPGA design and behavior.

### Why this project?

FPGAs are widely used in the aerospace industry for various applications, including satellite communication, image processing, and data acquisition. Understanding how FPGAs work is essential for engineers and researchers working in the aerospace sector. However, learning FPGA design can be challenging due to the complex nature of the hardware and software involved. By providing an interactive visualization tool, we aim to simplify the learning process and make it more accessible to students and teachers. This project aligns with CNES's mission to promote STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education and foster innovation in the aerospace sector.

## Scope

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Front-end**: The web-based interface that users interact with. This includes the visualization of the FPGA structure and signal propagation, as well as the user interface for uploading and running simulations.
2. **Back-end**: The server-side application that handles file uploads, simulation execution, and communication with the front end.

### Software architecture

The software architecture will be based on the following components:

- The website, a single-page application built with React, will provide the user interface for interacting with the FPGA simulator.
- The FPGA simulator, implemented in D3.js and JavaScript, will handle the simulation of signal propagation through the FPGA structure.
- The parser, written in JavaScript, will convert the `.sdf` file into a JSON object that can be used to generate the FPGA structure.
- The back-end server, built with Node.js, will handle file uploads, simulation execution, and communication with the front end.

Here's a look at the high-level architecture of the system:

![Software Architecture](./Images/SoftwareArchitecture.png)

The software architecture of this FPGA visualization web application is structured into three main components: the Frontend, the Backend, and the Parser. The front, built with React and D3.js, provides an interactive user interface where users can upload an SDF file and visualize the FPGA structure. Once a file is uploaded, it is sent to the Backend via an API.

The Backend, developed with Node.js, acts as an intermediary between the front-end and the Parser. It receives the uploaded SDF file through the File Upload API and forwards it to the Parsing Service, which is responsible for extracting relevant timing and structural data from the file.

The Parser, implemented in JavaScript or Python, processes the SDF file, extracts information about timing constraints and component connections, and converts it into a JSON format that the front end can easily interpret. The Backend then returns this JSON data to the Frontend, which uses it to dynamically render the FPGA structure, allowing users to explore signal connections and propagation through an intuitive visualization.

This modular architecture ensures scalability, separation of concerns, and efficient processing of FPGA-related data, making it adaptable for future extensions and improvements.

### File and folder structure

### Website

The goal of the website is to provide an intuitive and interactive user interface for uploading Verilog applications, running simulations, visualizing FPGA structures, and signal propagation.

#### Frontend

Based on the mockup approved by the customer, the frontend will consist of the following components:

- **Main content**: The main content area where the FPGA structure visualization will be displayed. This will include the FPGA grid, signal lines, and interactive components for controlling simulations such as arrows to move backward and forward in time.
- **Sidebar**: The sidebar area where logs will be displayed.
- **Header**: The header area with the project name and a button for uploading files.
- **Footer**: The footer area has copyright information and links to relevant resources.
- **Upload Form**: A dedicated form for uploading `.sdf` files that will appear when the user clicks the upload button in the header or at the start of the application.

The front end will be implemented using React, D3.js, and other libraries as needed to create an engaging and interactive user experience. The team will follow best practices for web development, including responsive design, accessibility, and performance optimization, to ensure that the application is user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users.

#### Backend

The backend will be responsible for **handling file uploads**, **running simulations**, and **communicating with the front end**. It will be implemented using Node.js and Express.js to create a **RESTful API** with which the front end can interact. The backend will include the following components:

- **File Upload API**: An API endpoint for uploading `.sdf` files to the server.
- **Parser Service**: A service for parsing `.sdf` files and extracting relevant data for simulations.
- **Simulation API**: An API endpoint for running simulations and returning the results to the front end.
- **Simulation Service**: A service for simulating signal propagation through the FPGA structure and updating the front end with the results.

The most important and complex part of the backend will be the parser service, which will be responsible for parsing `.sdf` files and converting them into a format that the front end can use to generate the FPGA structure visualization. The team will pay specific attention to error handling, data validation, and performance optimization to ensure that the parser service is robust, reliable, and efficient.

##### File upload

Uploading the file isn't too complex, but it's important to handle it correctly. The team will use the following steps to handle the file upload:

1. **Interaction**: The user will click on the upload button in the header or at the start of the application.
2. **File selection**: The user will select the `.sdf` file to upload.
3. **File upload**: The file will be uploaded to the website
4. **File processing**: The file will be processed by the backend to extract the relevant data.
5. **File saving**: The transformed file will be saved in the local cache.

#### Parser

The parser will be implemented in JavaScript or Python, depending on the team's expertise and preferences. It will read the `.sdf` file, extract relevant information about the FPGA structure, and convert it into a JSON object that can be easily used by the front end. The parser will handle different types of cells, delays, and connections, ensuring that the data is accurate and consistent for visualization and simulation.

> [!WARNING]
> Important information to know is that the delay is in picoseconds. In the first lines of the `.sdf` file, you can find the time unit used in the file.
>
> ```sdf
> (TIMESCALE 1ps)
> ```

Here are all the types of cells we might find in the `.sdf` file:

##### FPGA Interconnect

```sdf
 (CELL
 (CELLTYPE "fpga_interconnect")
 (INSTANCE routing_segment_D_output_0_0_to_lut_\$auto\$rtlil\.cc\:2714\:MuxGate\$175_input_0_3)
 (DELAY
 (ABSOLUTE
 (IOPATH datain dataout (235.697:235.697:235.697) (235.697:235.697:235.697))
 )
 )
 )
```

Those simply link two points and delay this interaction. In the case just above, to go from `segment_D_output_0_0` to `lut_\$auto\$rtlil\.cc\:2714\:MuxGate\$175_input_0_3`, it will take 235.697 picoseconds/ps (10⁻¹² second).

The information we need to extract from this cell is the following:

- The type of the cell: `fpga_interconnect`
- The starting point: `segment_D_output_0_0`
- The ending point: `lut_\$auto\$rtlil\.cc\:2714\:MuxGate\$175_input_0_3`
- The delay: `235.697`

##### LUT_K

```sdf
 (CELL
 (CELLTYPE "LUT_K")
 (INSTANCE lut_\$auto\$rtlil\.cc\:2714\:MuxGate\$139)
 (DELAY
 (ABSOLUTE
 (IOPATH in[1] out (152:152:152) (152:152:152))
 (IOPATH in[2] out (150:150:150) (150:150:150))
 (IOPATH in[3] out (150:150:150) (150:150:150))
 )
 )
 )
```

Those are the LUTs, which are the basic components of the FPGA. They are used to store the logic of the FPGA. In the case just above, the LUT is named `lut_\$auto\$rtlil\.cc\:2714\:MuxGate\$139`.

The information we need to extract from this cell is the following:

- The type of the cell: `LUT_K`
- The name of the LUT: `lut_\$auto\$rtlil\.cc\:2714\:MuxGate\$139`
- The delays for each input: `152`, `150`, `150`

##### DFF

```sdf
 (CELL
 (CELLTYPE "DFF")
 (INSTANCE latch_Q)
 (DELAY
 (ABSOLUTE
 (IOPATH (posedge clock) Q (303:303:303) (303:303:303))
 )
 )
 (TIMINGCHECK
 (SETUP D (posedge clock) (-46:-46:-46))
 )
 )
```

Those are the DFFs, which are used to store the state of the FPGA. In the case just above, the DFF is named `latch_Q`. The DFF is triggered by the rising edge of the clock.

The information we need to extract from this cell is the following:

- The type of the cell: `DFF`
- The name of the DFF: `latch_Q`
- The delay for the clock: `303`
- The timing check for the setup: `-46`

Here's a hypothetical example of the JSON object that the parser might generate based on the `.sdf` file:

```json
{
  "cells": [
    {
      "type": "fpga_interconnect",
      "start": "segment_D_output_0_0",
      "end": "lut_$auto$rtlil.cc:2714:MuxGate$175_input_0_3",
      "delay": 235.697
    },
    {
      "type": "LUT_K",
      "name": "lut_$auto$rtlil.cc:2714:MuxGate$139",
      "delays": [152, 150, 150]
    },
    {
      "type": "DFF",
      "name": "latch_Q",
      "delay": 303,
      "timing_check": -46
    }
  ]
}
```

The parser will be designed to handle different types of cells, delays, and connections, ensuring that the data is accurate and consistent for visualization and simulation.

### FPGA structure generation

This section explains how the JSON data extracted from the .sdf file is used to generate an interactive visualization of the FPGA. The goal is to correctly **place**, **connect**, and **simulate** the different components while allowing user interactions to observe and manipulate signal propagation.

#### Backend processing

Once the `.sdf` file is parsed and converted into JSON, the backend is responsible for extracting the relevant data and constructing a logical representation of the FPGA.

The steps are the following:

1. Load the JSON data from the parser service.
2. Extract all cell instances and categorize them by type (e.g., LUTs, DFFs, interconnects).
3. Create a graph structure where:
   - Nodes represent an FPGA cell.
   - Edges represent a signal connection between two cells.
4. Optimize the graph by removing redundant connections and structuring the data for efficient front-end rendering.
5. Send the optimized graph data to the front end for visualization.

Example of a graph structure:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "DFF1", "type": "DFF", "tick": 303 },
    { "id": "LUT1", "type": "LUT" },
    { "id": "High1", "type": "HighConst" },
    { "id": "Input1", "type": "Input" }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "source": "DFF1", "target": "LUT1", "delay": 152 },
    { "source": "High1", "target": "LUT1", "delay": 150 },
    { "source": "Input1", "target": "LUT1", "delay": 150 }
  ]
}
```

In the example above, we have four nodes representing a DFF, a LUT, a high constant, and an input. The edges represent signal connections between the nodes, with delays specified for each connection.

The front end will use this graph data to render the FPGA structure, visualize signal propagation, and provide interactive controls for running simulations and observing results.

### Visualization

Now that the `.json` file has been structured, the backend must process this data to create a logical representation of the FPGA. The front end will then use this data to render an interactive visualization of the FPGA structure and signal propagation.

#### Generate the visualization

- Nodes are dynamically placed on a grid based on their type and connections.
- Edges are drawn between nodes to represent signal connections, with different colors and styles to indicate signal propagation.
- Simulation can now run step-by-step.

To match the requirement the first time, the team will use a simple representation of the FPGA structure, with basic shapes for nodes and lines for connections. The team will focus on functionality first, ensuring that the visualization accurately represents the FPGA structure and signal propagation.

Placement will be important for the first part, as we need to be readable and easy to understand for all users. As our client is based in Europe, reading from left to right, the team will place the user inputs on the left side and the outputs on the right side. The DFFs and LUTs will be placed in the middle, with the interconnects connecting them.

The first expected version should be a simple square with the ID of the component in the middle. The edges will be simple lines connecting the components, with no color, no thickness, and no animation.

#### Wire management and signal propagation simulation

The front-end will use **D3.js** to create a dynamic visualization of the board allowing users to observe signal propagation and analyze the FPGA design.

##### 1. Wire Management and Routing

To ensure **clarity, accuracy, and interactivity** in FPGA wire visualization, the system will implement the following:

- **Dynamic Wire Rendering:**

  - Connections will be represented using **SVG paths (`<path>`)**, with smooth **curved** or **straight-line routing** for optimal readability.
  - Wire paths will automatically **adjust** as nodes move, maintaining a clean layout.

- **Automated Routing & Overlap Prevention:**

  - The system will implement **collision-aware routing** to avoid **wire congestion**.
  - **Spacing algorithms** will ensure clear separation between overlapping signals.
  - **Grid-based or force-directed layouts** will help position connections logically.

- **Interactive Wire Adjustments:**
  - The system will **auto-snap wires** to valid positions, ensuring accurate routing.
  - **Hover effects** will highlight the source and destination of each connection.

##### 2. Signal categorization with color coding

To differentiate signal types and improve readability, a **color-coded system** will be applied:

| Signal Type | Default Color | "On" State (Brighter)        |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Clock**   | 🔴 Red        | 🔴 Brighter Red (Thicker)    |
| **Data**    | 🟢 Green      | 🟢 Brighter Green (Thicker)  |
| **Control** | 🔵 Blue       | 🔵 Brighter Blue (Thicker)   |
| **Reset**   | 🟡 Yellow     | 🟡 Brighter Yellow (Thicker) |
| **Other**   | ⚫ Black      | ⚫ Brighter Black (Thicker)  |
| **Unused**  | ⚪ Gray       | /                            |

When a signal is active, the corresponding wire will **increase in brightness and thickness**, making propagation visually distinct.

##### 3. Signal Styling with CSS

To implement this, CSS classes will be used:

```css
/* Default state */
.signal__clock {
  stroke: #ff0000;
}

/* Active signal */
.signal__clock--on {
  stroke: #ff3333;
  stroke-width: 2;
}
```

This logic will be applied to all signals, ensuring real-time updates in response to simulation data.

##### 4. Signal Propagation Simulation

The simulation will model real FPGA signal behavior based on delays extracted from the `.sdf` file. Key features:

- **Time-based animation** to show signals traveling across interconnects.
- **Step-through controls** to pause, rewind, and fast-forward propagation.
- **Live updates on signal states**, highlighting active paths and values.

As signals move, affected wires will animate accordingly, transitioning from off to on states using the defined color and thickness rules. Providing a clear visual representation of signal propagation will enhance user understanding and engagement.

> [!NOTE]
> The visualization will be designed to be user-friendly, interactive, and informative, providing a clear and intuitive representation of the FPGA structure and signal propagation, as you might see in the mockup shared in the [Functional Specifications](../FunctionalSpecifications/FunctionalSpecifications.md).

##### Bézier curve

To prevent **wire congestion and overlapping connections**, the system will use **Bézier curves** for routing. Bézier curves allow for **smooth, visually distinct paths**, making complex FPGA wiring easier to follow.

###### Why Bézier Curves?

- They provide a **cleaner** and **more readable** representation of signal paths.
- Unlike straight lines, Bézier curves help prevent visual clutter when multiple wires are present.
- They allow **dynamic adjustments**, automatically updating when nodes move.

###### Implementation Details

Bézier curves in **SVG** can be created using the `C` (cubic Bézier) or `Q` (quadratic Bézier) command in an `<svg>` `<path>` element.

Example of an **SVG Bézier curve** for routing a wire between two FPGA nodes:

```html
<svg width="400" height="200">
  <path

###### Breaking Down the Bézier Curve Command

```plaintext
M 50,100    → Move to starting point (x=50, y=100)
C 150,50    → First control point (x=150, y=50)
 250,150   → Second control point (x=250, y=150)
 350,100   → Endpoint (x=350, y=100)
```

- **Control points** define the curve's shape.
- The **closer** a control point is to a segment, the more influence it has on the curve.

###### Dynamic Bézier Curve in D3.js

To generate dynamic routing, D3.js can be used to update Bézier paths **automatically** based on node positions:

```js
const link = d3
  .select("svg")
  .append("path")
  .attr(
    "d",
    `M ${x1},${y1} C ${x1 + 50},${y1 - 50}, ${x2 - 50},${y2 + 50}, ${x2},${y2}`
  )
  .attr("stroke", "black")
  .attr("fill", "none")
  .attr("stroke-width", 2);
```

###### Collision Avoidance Strategy

1. **Dynamic Control Points:**
   - Adjust **control points dynamically** to curve around obstacles.
2. **Spacing Constraints:**
   - Prevent overlapping by checking distances between parallel wires.
3. **Force-Directed Layouts:**
   - Use **D3.js force simulations** to push wires apart for better clarity.

#### Logs

One key feature of this project is the ability to display logs to the user. The logs will be displayed in the sidebar of the application and will provide information on the simulation based on the time and the step.

##### Logs creation

The logs will be created based on the simulation data and user interactions. The logs will include information about the simulation status, signal propagation, and user actions. Each log entry will be timestamped to indicate when it occurred. Each log entry will be saved in an array or object that can be accessed and updated as needed.

To be able to create logs, the team will need to create a function that will look into the `.json` file and extract the relevant information to create the logs. The logs will be created based on the simulation data and user interactions. The logs will include information about the simulation status, signal propagation, and user actions. Each log entry will be timestamped to indicate when it occurred.

Here's a hypothetical example of how the logs might be created in the back end:

```js
const logs = [];

function logEvent(timestamp, message) {
  logs.push({ timestamp, message });
}
```

The function `logEvent` will be used to create a new log entry with a timestamp and a message. The logs will be stored in an array called `logs`, which can be accessed and updated as needed. This function will be called whenever an event occurs that requires logging, such as the start of the simulation, signal propagation, or user interactions.

##### Logs display

The logs will be displayed in chronological order, with the oldest logs at the top and the newest logs at the bottom. Each log entry will include the following information:

- **Timestamp**: The time at which the log entry was generated.
- **Message**: A brief description of the event or action that triggered the log entry.

The logs will be saved in an invisible table, with each row representing a log entry and each column representing a different field (timestamp, message). The logs will be updated based on the steps button the user clicks.

Here's a hypothetical example of how the logs might be displayed in the sidebar:

```plaintext
00:00 Simulation started
00:10 Signal A propagated from LUT1 to DFF1
00:25 Signal B propagated from Input1 to LUT1
00:53 Simulation paused
```

#### Step buttons

The step buttons will allow the user to control the simulation by moving forward or backward in time. The step buttons will be displayed in the header of the application and will include the following options:

- **Start**: Move to the beginning of the simulation.
- **Previous**: Move back one step in the simulation.
- **Next**: Move forward one step in the simulation.
- **End**: Move to the end of the simulation.

The step buttons will be implemented using HTML buttons with event listeners to handle user interactions. When a step button is clicked, the simulation will update the visualization and logs to reflect the current state of the simulation at the selected time.

Here's a hypothetical example of how the step buttons might be implemented in the front end:

```js
const first = document.getElementById("start-btn");
const previous = document.getElementById("previous-btn");
const next = document.getElementById("next-btn");
const last = document.getElementById("end-btn");
const logTable = document.getElementById("log-table");
const stepValue = document.getElementById("step-value");

let currentStep = 0;

first.addEventListener("click", () => {
  currentStep = 0;
  stepValue.textContent = currentStep;
  updateLogs(currentStep);
});

previous.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (currentStep > 0) {
    currentStep--;
    stepValue.textContent = currentStep;
    updateLogs(currentStep);
  }
});

next.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (currentStep < logs.length - 1) {
    currentStep++;
    stepValue.textContent = currentStep;
    updateLogs(currentStep);
  }
});

last.addEventListener("click", () => {
  currentStep = logs.length - 1;
  stepValue.textContent = currentStep;
  updateLogs(currentStep);
});

function updateLogs(step) {
  logTable.innerHTML = "";
  for (let i = 0; i <= step; i++) {
    const log = logs[i];
    const row = document.createElement("tr");
    const timestampCell = document.createElement("td");
    const messageCell = document.createElement("td");
    timestampCell.textContent = log.timestamp;
    messageCell.textContent = log.message;
    row.appendChild(timestampCell);
    row.appendChild(messageCell);
    logTable.appendChild(row);
  }
}
```

As you might see in the pseudo-code above, the logs will be updated based on the steps the user clicks. The user will be able to go back and forth in the simulation to see the logs at different times. If the backward button is pressed, the logs will be updated to show the logs at the previous step. If the forward button is pressed, the logs will be updated to show the logs at the next step.

#### Zoom Buttons

The zoom buttons will allow the user to control the zoom level of the FPGA structure visualization. The zoom buttons will be displayed in the footer of the application and will include the following options:

- **Zoom In**: Increase the zoom level of the visualization.
- **Zoom Out**: Decrease the zoom level of the visualization.

The zoom buttons will be implemented using HTML buttons with event listeners to handle user interactions. When a zoom button is clicked, the visualization will update to reflect the new zoom level, making it easier for users to explore the FPGA structure and signal propagation.

Here's a hypothetical example of how the zoom buttons might be implemented in the front end:

```js
const zoomIn = document.getElementById("zoom-in-btn");
const zoomOut = document.getElementById("zoom-out-btn");

let zoomLevel = 1;
const maxZoom = 3; // Maximum zoom level
const minZoom = 0.5; // Minimum zoom level

// Store the visualization element that needs zooming
const visualization = document.getElementById("fpga-window");

zoomIn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (zoomLevel < maxZoom) {
    zoomLevel += 0.1;
    updateZoom(zoomLevel);
  }
});

zoomOut.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (zoomLevel > minZoom) {
    zoomLevel -= 0.1;
    updateZoom(zoomLevel);
  }
});

function updateZoom(level) {
  // Apply the scale transform to the visualization element
  visualization.style.transform = `scale(${level})`;
  visualization.style.transformOrigin = "center center"; // Keep the scaling centered
  console.log(`Zoom Level: ${level}`);
}
```

As you might see in the pseudo-code above, the zoom level will be updated based on the zoom button the user clicks. The user will be able to zoom in and out of the visualization to explore the FPGA structure and signal propagation at different levels of detail.

#### Panning the Visualization

When users zoom in on the FPGA structure, they may need to pan across the visualization to explore different sections of the structure. This can be achieved by allowing the user to drag or use navigation controls such as buttons or a slider.

To implement this, we can add a simple panning feature using mouse dragging and/or arrow buttons. Here's an example of how the panning functionality might be implemented:

```js
let isPanning = false;
let startX = 0;
let startY = 0;

visualization.addEventListener("mousedown", (e) => {
  isPanning = true;
  startX = e.clientX;
  startY = e.clientY;
});

visualization.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
  if (isPanning) {
    const dx = e.clientX - startX;
    const dy = e.clientY - startY;
    visualization.style.transform = `scale(${zoomLevel}) translate(${dx}px, ${dy}px)`;
  }
});

visualization.addEventListener("mouseup", () => {
  isPanning = false;
});

visualization.addEventListener("mouseleave", () => {
  isPanning = false;
});
```

### Explanation:

- **Panning**: The user can click and drag the mouse to move the visualization (translate it) across the screen. When the mouse is pressed down, the `mousedown` event starts the panning, and the `mousemove` event is used to apply the translation based on how far the mouse has moved.
- **Mouse Up/Leave**: When the user releases the mouse or leaves the visualization area, the panning stops.

#### Alternative Navigation Controls (Buttons or Slider)

In addition to panning via mouse dragging, we could also provide a set of navigation controls (like arrow buttons or a slider) for panning the visualization horizontally and vertically. Here's an example of a horizontal slider that moves the visualization left and right:

```html
<div id="horizontal-slider">
  <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="50" id="slider" />
</div>

<script>
  const slider = document.getElementById("slider");

  slider.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
    const sliderValue = e.target.value;
    const offset = sliderValue - 50; // Centered at 50
    visualization.style.transform = `scale(${zoomLevel}) translateX(${offset}px)`;
  });
</script>
```

This code creates a horizontal slider that lets users move the FPGA structure left and right based on the zoom level. You can also implement vertical sliders or arrow buttons for more fine-grained control over panning.

## Risks and mitigation strategies

The project may face several risks during development, including technical challenges, resource constraints, and schedule delays. To mitigate these risks, the team has identified the following strategies:

1. **Technical Risks**: The team may encounter technical challenges related to parsing SDF files, simulating signal propagation, or integrating front-end and back-end components. To mitigate these risks, the team will conduct thorough research, seek expert advice, and leverage online resources to address technical issues as they arise.
2. **Resource Constraints**: The team may face resource constraints, such as limited access to hardware, software, or expertise. To mitigate these risks, the team will collaborate with the customer, leverage open-source tools and libraries, and seek external support if needed.
3. **Schedule Delays**: The project may experience delays due to unforeseen circumstances, such as technical setbacks, scope changes, or resource limitations. To mitigate these risks, the team will maintain regular communication, track progress, and adjust the project plan as needed to ensure timely delivery.

By identifying potential risks and implementing mitigation strategies, the team aims to minimize the impact of unforeseen challenges and ensure the successful completion of the project.
