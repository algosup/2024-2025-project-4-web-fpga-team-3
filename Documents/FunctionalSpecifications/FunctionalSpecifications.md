**ðŸ“• Note:** This mockup represents the initial version of our simulation interface. Some modifications will be made during the implementation phase. Below are key points to consider:

### 3.3 Key Points for Implementation and Improvement.

- **Improve View Clarity:**
  - **Wire Organization**: Group wires horizontally and vertically to maintain a clean and organized layout.
  - **Element Simplification**: Remove elements like **Enable** and **Reset** to enhance clarity.
  - **Menu Icon**: Display a small menu icon at the top right of the screen. Clicking this icon will allow teachers to upload new Verilog and SDF files.
  - **First-Time User Notification**: If a user runs the simulation for the first time, display a small pop-up notification prompting them to upload their files to initiate the simulation.

- **Element Identification:**
  - **Grid Labels**: Place row and column numbers on the borders for easy element identification, avoiding clutter within the elements.

- **Refine Transition Animation:**
  - **Signal Propagation**: Enhance the transition animation to accurately depict signal propagation through the wires.
  - **Visual Effects**: Adjust the blur effect to better illustrate signal movement. Use a mix of red and green colors, each 1mm in length, on active signal lines to distinguish different signal states.

- **Distinguish Input/Output Elements:**
  - **Clear Categorization**: Treat input and output elements as distinct entities, similar to flip-flops and LUTs. Avoid mixing them with names like clock, enable, or reset to maintain clear categorization.

- **Comprehensive Log Information:**
  - **Detailed Logs**: Expand the log to include all clock edges and Basic Logic Elements (BLEs) information, indicating whether they are **on** or **off**. This provides a complete understanding of signal movement within the FPGA.
