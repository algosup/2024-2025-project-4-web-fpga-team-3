- Provides navigation tools (zoom, pan) for exploring the FPGA layout
- Includes a backend system for teachers to add example applications and testbenches

### 1.3 Intended Audience

**ðŸ“•NB:** This mockup images is the first version of our simulation representing how the interface will be display, but some slight modification shall be made during the
implementation phase. Here under are keypoint to take into consideration during the implementation phase.

- **Improve View Clarity:**
  - Wires between elements will be grouped horizontally and vertically to maintain a clean and organized layout.
  - Elements like **Enable and Reset** will be removed to improve clarity,

- **Element Identification:**
  - Row and column numbers will be placed on the borders for element identification, avoiding placement inside the elements to prevent display clutter.

- **Refine Transition Animation:**
  - The transition animation will be refined to accurately represent signal propagation through the wires. The blur effect will be adjusted to better illustrate signal movement. Instead of using only the red color, a mix of red and green color of 1mm each on active signal line.

- **Distinguish Input/Output Elements:**
  - Input and output elements will be treated as distinct entities, similar to flip-flops and LUTs. They will not be mixed with names like clock, enable, or reset to maintain clear categorization.

- **Comprehensive Log Information:**
  - The log will be expanded to include all clock edges and BLEs information whether they are **on or off**, to provide a complete understanding of signal movement within the FPGA.
