**ðŸ“• Note:** This mockup represents the initial version of our simulation interface. Some modifications will be made during the implementation phase. Below are key points to consider:

### 3.3 Key Points for Implementation and Improvement.

- **Improve View Clarity:**
  - **Wire Organization**: Group wires horizontally and vertically to maintain a clean and organized layout.
  - **Element Simplification**: Remove elements like **Enable** and **Reset** to enhance clarity.
  - **Menu Icon**: Display a small menu icon at the top right of the screen. Clicking this icon will allow teachers to upload new Verilog and SDF files.
  - **First-Time User Notification**: If a user runs the simulation for the first time, display a small pop-up notification prompting them to upload their files to initiate the simulation.

- **Element Identification:**
  - **Grid Labels**: Place row and column numbers on the borders for easy element identification, avoiding clutter within the elements.

- **Refine Transition Animation:**
  - **Signal Propagation**: Enhance the transition animation to accurately depict signal propagation through the wires.
  - **Visual Effects**: Adjust the blur effect to better illustrate signal movement. Use a mix of red and green colors, each 1mm in length, on active signal lines to distinguish different signal states.

- **Distinguish Input/Output Elements:**
  - **Clear Categorization**: Treat input and output elements as distinct entities, similar to flip-flops and LUTs. Avoid mixing them with names like clock, enable, or reset to maintain clear categorization.

- **Comprehensive Log Information:**
  - **Detailed Logs**: Expand the log to include all clock edges and Basic Logic Elements (BLEs) information, indicating whether they are **on** or **off**. This provides a complete understanding of signal movement within the FPGA.

### Improvements Made:
- **Clarity and Conciseness**: Simplified language and removed redundancies for better readability.
- **Structured Formatting**: Organized points into clear categories with sub-points for easier navigation.
- **Consistent Terminology**: Used consistent terms and removed unnecessary capitalization for a more professional tone.
- **User-Friendly Instructions**: Provided clear instructions for user interactions, such as the menu icon and first-time user notification.

These improvements should make the notes more accessible and actionable for the implementation team.

   - **Visualization Tools**: Use libraries like D3.js or Three.js to render the 2D FPGA layout and signal propagation based on the JSON data.

4. **API Integration**:
   - **RESTful APIs**: Define clear and secure API endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend.
   - **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to protect API access and ensure data integrity.


#### 8.3.3 Benefits
- **Seamless Data Flow**: Ensures smooth data transition between different system components, from file upload to simulation visualization.
- **Scalability**: Supports the addition of new features or tools without disrupting existing workflows.
- **Consistency**: The use of a standardized JSON format maintains data consistency across the system.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Enhances user experience with real-time updates and interactive visualizations.

### 9.1 Glossary of Terms

- **FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array):** An integrated circuit designed to be configured by the customer or designer after manufacturing. It consists of basic elements and preconfigured electrical signal routes. The selected FPGA for this project is a NanoXplore NGultra (with VTR flow a basic Xilinx serie 7 model).

- **BEL (Basic Element):** The fundamental hardware electrical resources available inside the FPGA, such as flip-flops, Look-Up Tables (LUTs), and Block RAM.

- **Application:** The function or design intended to be executed within the FPGA, typically developed using Verilog.

- **Synthesis:** The process of translating the application's high-level description (e.g., Verilog code) into an electrical equivalent, resulting in a netlist. Tools like Impulse or Yosys (in VTR flow) are used for this process.

- **P&R (Place and Route):** The process of placing the netlist components within the FPGA's available BELs (Place) and selecting routes for signals between each BEL (Route). Tools like Impulse or VPR (for VTR flow) are used for this process.

- **Simulator:** A tool that compiles Verilog testbenches and applications, executing the simulation of signal behavior over time. Modelsim (or Icarus Verilog for VTR flow) is used for this purpose.

- **Software:** The web application developed as part of this project, designed to visualize and simulate signal propagation within an FPGA.

- **Verilog:** A hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It is used to describe the behavior and structure of digital circuits.

- **SDF (Standard Delay Format):** A file format used to specify timing information for digital circuits, including delays and timing constraints.

- **Netlist:** A description of the connectivity of an electronic design, listing the components and their interconnections. It is generated during the synthesis process.

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight data interchange format used to structure data in a human-readable way. In this project, JSON is used as an intermediary format to bridge backend processing and frontend visualization.

- **Web Interface:** The user-friendly frontend of the software, allowing students to visualize and interact with FPGA simulations.

- **Simulation Engine:** The backend component responsible for running simulations based on the pivot file and user interactions.

- **Backend:** The server-side part of the application, handling file uploads, processing, and managing simulation data.

- **Frontend:** The client-side part of the application, providing the user interface for interacting with the simulation.

- **Pivot File:** A standardized JSON file format used to bridge backend processing and frontend visualization, containing necessary simulation data.

- **VTR Flow:** A set of tools and processes used for FPGA design, including synthesis, place and route, and simulation. It is used as an alternative flow in this project.
